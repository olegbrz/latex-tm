# LaTeX Template Manager

When using LaTeX to write documents, most people usually have templates to reuse. The annoying part comes when you write many documents with LaTeX, and each time you have to manually copy the template from some directory where you have it saved.

LaTeX TM aims to solve this problem. All you need to do is to save all templates in a folder, each one with a metadata file. This script will parse the folder for templates and simplify the process of importing the template into a desired folder.

## Usage

To use the script, just save it in `/usr/local/bin` and give it execution permissions:

```bash
chmod +x ./tex2dir.py
```
